## 📌 Overview
This project implements **N-gram probability estimators** using PySpark:

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**
- **Good–Turing Smoothing**
- **Absolute Discounting (AD)**

Evaluation focuses on **rare-event probability correction**, divergence metrics, and Zipfian behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare estimator performance at multiple sample sizes  
- Quantify divergence from reference “full corpus” distribution  
- Visualize rank-frequency and tail behavior  

---

## 🛠️ Stack
`PySpark` · `NumPy` · `pandas` · `matplotlib`

## 🔬 Key Findings

### **Good–Turing**
- Best for long-tail corrections  
- Stabilizes rare-event probability mass  

### **Absolute Discounting**
- Most stable across mid-frequency tokens  

### **MLE**
- Overfits high-frequency words  
- Fails on sparse vocabularies  

### Convergence
All estimators begin stabilizing by **~1 million tokens**.

## 📊 Deliverables
- Zipf curves  
- Divergence plots (KL, JS, L1)  
- Smoothing comparison tables  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Extend to **Kneser–Ney smoothing**  
- Implement a small **backoff language model**  
- Integrate into a streaming text pipeline
