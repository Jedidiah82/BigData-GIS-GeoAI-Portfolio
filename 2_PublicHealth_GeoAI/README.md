# 🏥 Public Health GeoAI & Spatio-Temporal Modeling

This section contains projects bridging **public health**, **GIS**, **machine learning**, and **GeoAI**.  
They are crafted to align with the workflows used by:

- CDC Foundation  
- WHO, UNICEF, UNDP  
- FHI360, RTI International, PATH  
- Ministries of Health (DHIS2, surveillance units)  
- Africa CDC / AFENET
