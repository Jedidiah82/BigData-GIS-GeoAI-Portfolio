Use cases:
- Conservation  
- Agriculture  
- Climate resilience  

---

## Workflow

### 1. Datasets
- Landsat 8 imagery  
- DEM  
- Land-cover training polygons  

### 2. Methods
- Preprocessing (cloud mask, TOA reflectance)  
- NDVI generation  
- Change detection (2015 → 2020)  
- Supervised classification (e.g., Random Forest)  
- Accuracy assessment  

### 3. Outputs
- NDVI maps  
- Degradation hotspot maps  
- Change detection matrix
