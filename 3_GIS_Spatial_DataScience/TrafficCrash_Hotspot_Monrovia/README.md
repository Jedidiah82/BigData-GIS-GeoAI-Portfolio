## Data & Methods

### 1. Inputs
- Crash point data (coordinates, severity)  
- Road network  
- Administrative boundaries  

### 2. Analytic Methods
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)  
- Network-constrained KDE (optional)  
- Segment risk scoring  
- Time-of-day / day-of-week trend analysis  

### 3. Outputs
- Hotspot raster maps  
- Ranked high-risk segments  
- Summary dashboards

## Next Steps
- Train a GeoAI crash prediction model  
- Add road attributes (speed, lighting, width)  
- Build a Monrovia “Road Risk Index”
